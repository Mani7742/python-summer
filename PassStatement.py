#----------------------------------< Pass Statement >------------------------------------------------
# Pass Statement is used to skip the code execution
# It is used when we don't want to write any code in a function or a block of
# code
# pass statement is used to make an empty loop
# for i in range(10):
    
# print("Kam kr Bhai")    ---> we will get an error bacause we cannot make the llop empty

for i in range(10):
    pass
print("Kam kr Bhai")    # Now the error is no more
